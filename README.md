## Folder Structure

```plaintext
├── frontend/          # Next.js 15 frontend application
├── studio/            # Sanity Studio v3
└── package.json       # Root workspace configuration
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the template repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vncsleal/sane-kit.git
cd sane-kit
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies for the entire monorepo from the root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create an `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory (`frontend/.env.local`) with the following variables:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production" # or your dataset name
# Optional: Add a read token for drafts if needed for preview
# SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN="YOUR_READ_TOKEN"

# Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX" # Your Google Analytics measurement ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY="phc_XXXXXXXXXXXX" # Your PostHog project API key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST="https://app.posthog.com" # Or your self-hosted PostHog instance URL
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual project IDs and API keys. You can find your Sanity project ID in your Sanity project settings or by running `sanity manage` in the `studio` directory.

### 4. Run the Development Servers

Start both the Next.js frontend and the Sanity Studio development servers concurrently from the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Your Next.js app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Your Sanity Studio will be running at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) (or the port specified in the root `package.json`)

Log in to the Studio using your Sanity account.

## Content Management

### Page Building

1. Create new pages in the Sanity Studio by adding new Page documents
2. Use the Page Builder field to construct your page with various section components
3. Each section type offers multiple variants and customization options
4. Create reusable components like Headers and Footers that can be shared across pages

### Internationalization

The kit comes with built-in support for multiple languages:

- Default language is English with Brazilian Portuguese as a secondary language
- Add more languages by modifying the language configuration in `sanity.config.ts`
- Use the `i18n_` prefixed fields to add translations for various content elements

## Deployment

### Deploy Studio

To deploy your Sanity Studio:

1.  Make sure you're logged in to your Sanity account:
    ```bash
    cd studio
    npx sanity login
    ```
2.  Deploy the studio from the root directory:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy:studio
    ```

### Deploy Frontend (Example: Vercel)

1.  Push your code to a Git provider (e.g., GitHub).
2.  Create a [new Vercel project](https://vercel.com/new) and connect it to your Git repository.
3.  **Important:** Set the **Root Directory** in Vercel project settings to `frontend`.
4.  Add the environment variables from `frontend/.env.local` to your Vercel project settings (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`, and `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` if used).
5.  Deploy!

### Configure CORS

Remember to add your deployed frontend URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`) to your Sanity project's CORS origins settings in the Sanity management console ([sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)).

## Environment Variables Summary

Located in `frontend/.env.example`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: Your Sanity project ID.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`: Your Sanity dataset name (e.g., `production`).
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` (Optional): Your Sanity API read token, required for fetching draft content if you implement preview functionality.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`: Your Google Analytics measurement ID.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`: Your PostHog project API key.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`: The URL of your PostHog instance (default is https://app.posthog.com).

## Analytics Capabilities

Sane-Kit comes with both Google Analytics and PostHog implementations:

### Google Analytics
